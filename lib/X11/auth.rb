#  This module is an approximate ruby replacement for the libXau C library and the 
#  xauth(1) program. It reads and interprets the files (usually '~/.Xauthority') that 
#  hold authorization data used in connecting to X servers. Since it was written mainly 
#  for the use of X11::Protocol, its functionality is currently restricted to reading, 
#  not writing, of these files.
